          I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, and at first, my hardware skills were stronger than my software skills. 
          I was worried about applying for jobs and entering the world of coding because I thought I wouldn’t be able to keep up. 
          But when I got accepted into a small company, I learned new frameworks that became my tools in the programming world.

          My background as a Computer Engineer with knowledge in both hardware and software also became an advantage. 
          It opened more opportunities for me and increased my value as both a Computer Engineer and a Software Developer.
